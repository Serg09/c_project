      %h1 Book Overview

      %p
        When did we become so tame? How has “the good life” come to mean addiction
        to screens and status, fossil fuels and financial fitness? Is it even
        possible to break free? Trek along with wilderness guide Todd Wynward as
        he “rewilds” the Jesus Way. Seek the feral foundations of Scripture and
        the lessons that the prophets and disciples gleaned from wilderness
        testing. Be inspired by contemporary individuals, communities, and churches
        that are caring for the land, the animals, and each other through practices
        such as reskilling, local food covenants, relational tithes, and co-housing.
        Drawing from modern-day prophets like Bill McKibben, Tim DeChristopher, and
        the New Monastics, Wynward offers hope and evidence and stories of radical
        rebellion and joyful enoughness. This book is for those who despair that the
        church’s half-hearted attempts at creation care are too little too late.

        Learn from those who are recovering from affluenza, replacing visions of
        personal wealth with the commonwealth of the planet, and restoring their
        humble place in the community of creation. If you fight despair about
        environmental degradation, join the growing band of seekers of God and makers
        of change who are rewilding the Way.

      %p
        Author, educator, and wilderness guide Todd Wynward is fanatic about
        reframing public education and re-envisioning the American way of life,
        starting with his own. He has been engaged in experiential education and
        social change movements for twenty years, and has spent more than a
        thousand nights outdoors. He has founded a wilderness-based public charter
        school, leads backpacking and river trips for adult seekers, and is an
        animating force behind TiLT, an intentional co-housing community in Taos,
        New Mexico. Richard Rohr calls his novel, The Secrets of Leaven, “a
        spiritual roller-coaster that skewers everything we think we know about
        organized religion, social change, and human potential."
