      %h1 Book Overview

      %p
        For many, Scripture falls into much the same category as Shakespeare:
        valued and enjoyed, but seldom understood. It is not, however, out of
        reach. The ability to identify the main themes of any passage is a skill
        you can learn, even as you seek to apply its truth to your own life.

      %p
        Covenant and Kingdom: The DNA of the Bible guides you on a Scriptural
        quest for knowledge and understanding. Stories and verse from the Old
        and New Testaments are woven together and cross-referenced, until the
        connections are clear and indisputable, like DNA from the Bible.

        Although the great Biblical themes of Covenant and Kingdom find their
        fullest expression in Jesus, Covenant goes all the way back to the
        beginning, when the only thing required was to maintain the “oneness”
        that God had created. After the Fall, the way was blocked; yet, God
        built a bridge, in Covenant, back to us. In Jesus, that Covenant was
        fulfilled, as on the cross, he offered himself as the ultimate blood
        sacrifice.

      %p
        The Bible is about God, our Father, inviting us to know him in a very
        real and personal way. Covenant and Kingdom: The DNA of the Bible
        provides guidance to the path of understanding that it will take to
        develop, to the fullest, your own individual relationship with God.
